## How to Play

2. Examine the snake photograph carefully (use zoom for details)
3. Choose from multiple choice!
4. Learn from correct/incorrect answers
5. Share your quiz with friends using the link

## Known Issues

### Won't Fix

- Taxonomy/species names are only as accurate as iNaturalist's database
- Some image quality may vary based on original observations
- Should be filtering out anything that is dead, but sometimes these are not properly categorized
- Location Guess text is not always useful or specific enough

## Planned Features

- Increased guess diversity
  - current quizes are dominated with T. sirtalis
- Detect locale/ increased globalization support
- Show additional photos for each guess, if there are any
- Quiz modes dedicated to specific, frequently confused species
  - e.g. a Cotton-Water mode (is it a cottonmouth or a watersnake???)
- HARD mode, you must type in the full scientific name instead of multi choice
- Mapped coordinates are shown for each question
